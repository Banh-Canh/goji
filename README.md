> [!NOTE] 
> Commitizen-like tool for formatting commit messages using emojis written in go.

**goji** is an easy-to-use commit message formatting tool, inspired by Commitizen and cz-cli, 
that helps you create conventional commits with emojis with streamlined [git] commit process by providing a user-friendly TUI 
for selecting the type of change, scope, and description of your commit message..

```sh
? Select the type of change you are committing: (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ feature   ‚ú®  Introducing new features.
  fix       üêõ  Fixing a bug.
  docs      üìö  Documentation change.
  refactor  üé®  Improve structure/format of the code.
  clean     üî•  Remove code or files.
```

## Features

- Interactive CLI for choosing commit types, scopes, and descriptions
- Predefined commit types with corresponding emojis
- Customizable commit types and scopes through a JSON configuration file
- Supports Git out of the box

## Install

**Homebrew**

```bash
brew install muandane/tap/goji
```

**Build locally**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muandane/goji.git && cd goji
go build -ldflags "-X goji/cmd.version=0.0.2"
mv goji /usr/local/bin
goji --version 
```

## Usage

Simply run `goji` in your terminal to start the interactive commit process:

## Customization

By default `goji` comes ready to run out of the box and you can initialize a config file with commands. _For now customization is in the works (?)_

```sh
goji --init --repo # Writes the config in the git repo's root
goji --init --global # Writes the config to home directory
```

**HOW TO**

You can customize the `.goji.json` generated file to add or change the scopes, types and other parameters:

```json
{
  "Types": [
    //***
    {
      "emoji": "‚ú®",
      "code": ":sparkles:",
      "description": "Introducing new features.",
      "name": "feat"
    },
    {
      "emoji": "üêõ",
      "code": ":bug:",
      "description": "Fixing a bug.",
      "name": "fix"
    }
    //***
  ],
  "Scopes": [
    "home",
    "accounts",
    "ci"
  ],
  "Symbol": true,
  "SkipQuestions": [],
  "SubjectMaxLength": 50
}
```

You can skip questions by adding them in `"SkipQuestions"`

Only `"Scopes"` question can be skipped since it's optional according to the [Commit Spec](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

If you don't want the interactive screen you can use the flags to construct a message:

```sh

goji --type feat --scope home --message "Add home page"

```
